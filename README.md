# DSC-510_Introduction-to-programming
Update weather.py

This project we will be creating an application to interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data. Your program will use all the information you’ve learned in the class in order to create a useful application.
The program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap. Your program must display the weather information in a READABLE format to the user.

Requirements:
o	Create a header for your program just as you have in the past.
o	Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
o	Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
o	Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
o	Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.
o	Use functions including a main function.
o	Allow the user to run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for multiple locations.
o	Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isn’t presented notify the user.
o	Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice. 
	Use Try blocks to ensure that your request was successful. If the connection was not successful display a message to the user.
o	Use Python 3
o	Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful
